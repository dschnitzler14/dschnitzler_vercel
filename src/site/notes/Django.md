## What is Django

Django is a framework for python for web development. It's a steep learning curve for someone who has been coding for all of 0.2 seconds.

## Why am I learning it then?
While it sometimes feels like a waste of time to be learning how to make sturdy websites (honestly it feels so far removed from science that I doubt my decisions sometimes), I *do*
want to learn it because it will help me build the thing that I actually want to build, which is the [[Paperstars/Meta Science\|Meta Science]]. 

## How am I learning it?
Mostly through Youtube videos, but I have also bought an online course because this guy did a good job explaining the concepts in the free taster videos. 

## So how's it going?
ish... I've finished [[django course 1\|django course 1]]/3 and am about half-way through django course 2, but that's honestly where I ran out of steam. At this point I just want to get started with the project.
