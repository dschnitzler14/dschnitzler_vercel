Coming to you from a Pret at 7:15am, today is my last day in Berlin.

My task list today is a little more meta - I have some work to do organising my task lists in notion. 

Overall, this week has been pretty productive - ticked a lot of things off my lists for [[Digital Gardening/L-analytics\|L-analytics]].
