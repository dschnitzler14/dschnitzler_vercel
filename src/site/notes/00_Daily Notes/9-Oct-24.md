From my to-do menu I am selecting the following tasks:

- fix automated lab email
- make plan of attack for [[L-Analytics Project/L-analytics\|L-analytics]] together with C

In a way, this is my first code review - looking at someone else's code and trying to improve it.

I also worked a little more on planning for the [[M14/M14\|M14]] experiment planning.
