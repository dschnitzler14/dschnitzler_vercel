brain was not braining [[14-Oct-24 \| yesterday]] - managed to read through the paper for JC and then I completely ran out of steam. i really don't work well on no sleep.

So, now, bright-eyed and ready to work this morning, I have selected the following tasks from my task menu
- add download options to plots for [[Digital Gardening/L-analytics\|L-analytics]] 
- finally start the [[0_Work/Meta-Science/Meta Science Writing\|Meta Science Writing]] by planning out the apps required

also i'm creating a [[Cheatsheet\|Cheatsheet]] with code snippets but also shortcuts.
