- finally take time to figure out how to create a modular [[Learning/shiny\|shiny]] app
- in my searching, just came across the [tidyverse styleguide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) which I will try to implement throughout future projects

- started working on modularising the current [[M14/M14\|M14]] teaching app, which itself needs expanding and tidying up

My day took a bit of a turn as I ended up on a bit of wild-goose chase trying to find one of the HR staff members, but eventually, I found the goose. Finding her was a multipurpose task - I wanted to introduce myself that she would be more inclined to help a me as a real person, rather than an anonymous name in an email. Anyway, success! Triple success actually, as not only was she very kind and helpful, I also got the opportunity to deal with additional admin-y things! 

Today definitely started off weird - I woke up, checked my phone, and was convinced it was 6am. So i got out of bed, took a shower, only to step out and realise it was actually only 1:30am. I don't know what time-bending witchery was at work there, but when I eventually got up for real, I headed straight to work, meaning I started at around 7am. Then I shlepped my way through Berlin (thank goodness for the amazing public transportation here!), only to get back to my colleague's apartment, exhausted.

I do feel that I managed to get a decent amount of work done today.
