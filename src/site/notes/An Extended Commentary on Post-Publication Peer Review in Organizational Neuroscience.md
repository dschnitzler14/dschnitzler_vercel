[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8RXWVIB9?page=2&annotation=EX2V5X8D) “critical evaluation of empirical works beyond the point of initial publication” ([Prochilo et al., 2019, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/BY9YFVWM))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8RXWVIB9?page=4&annotation=RTNSVVWK) “Science has been described as a cumulative and self-corrective process (Merton, 1973; Popper, 1962).” ([Prochilo et al., 2019, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/BY9YFVWM))

([Prochilo et al., 2019, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/BY9YFVWM)) look up JARS-Quant

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8RXWVIB9?page=5&annotation=U77HSN2D) “And the APA Working Group on Journal Article Reporting Standards (JARS-Quant) covers reporting of all forms of quantitative empirical work, regardless of subdiscipline (Appelbaum et al., 2018).” ([Prochilo et al., 2019, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/BY9YFVWM))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8RXWVIB9?page=5&annotation=QGN9I545) “A growing number of scholars are also raising concerns that a key theme in this crisis is an overreliance on the null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) approach when conducting research and interpreting results” ([Prochilo et al., 2019, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/BY9YFVWM))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8RXWVIB9?page=5&annotation=DSY8SL57) “prioritized all-or-none decisions (i.e., a finding is either statistically significant or non-significant) to the exclusion of information that describes the magnitude and precision of a finding, or whether that finding is likely to replicate” ([Prochilo et al., 2019, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/BY9YFVWM))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8RXWVIB9?page=6&annotation=V8LHPGEE) “The NHST approach has been well described elsewhere (see Frick, 1996; Nickerson, 2000). Briefly, an effect (or effect size) describes a quantification of some difference or a relationship that is computed on sample data.” ([Prochilo et al., 2019, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/BY9YFVWM))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8RXWVIB9?page=6&annotation=D9A2J5P8) “One of the major criticisms of this approach is that it simply does not provide researchers with the full information they need to describe the relationship between an independent and dependent variable” ([Prochilo et al., 2019, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/BY9YFVWM))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8RXWVIB9?page=6&annotation=BGIH8EDR) “p values are too often misconstrued or misused by its practitioners” ([Prochilo et al., 2019, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/BY9YFVWM))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8RXWVIB9?page=6&annotation=26TP44ZD) “parameter estimation” ([Prochilo et al., 2019, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/BY9YFVWM))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8RXWVIB9?page=6&annotation=P63T92TT) “inference should focus on: (1) the magnitude of a finding through reporting of effect size, (2) the accuracy and precision of a finding through reporting of confidence intervals on an effect size, and (3) an explicit focus on aggregate evidence through meta-analysis of multiple studies.” ([Prochilo et al., 2019, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/BY9YFVWM))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8RXWVIB9?page=6&annotation=9NNCZRJR) “Accuracy refers to the long run probability that a confidence interval of a given length will contain the true population value.” ([Prochilo et al., 2019, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/BY9YFVWM))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8RXWVIB9?page=6&annotation=8LFFQSJG) “It is therefore plausible (although, not certain) that any particular 95% confidence interval will contain the true population parameter.” ([Prochilo et al., 2019, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/BY9YFVWM))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8RXWVIB9?page=6&annotation=WXQJ9A5U) “Precision refers to a measure of the statistical variability of a parameter, and is quantified by the width of a confidence interval (or, alternatively, the half width of the confidence interval: the margin of error).” ([Prochilo et al., 2019, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/BY9YFVWM))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8RXWVIB9?page=6&annotation=JHIDLGGG) “narrow 95% confidence interval is said to have high precision in that there are a limited range of plausible values which the population parameter could take.” ([Prochilo et al., 2019, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/BY9YFVWM))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8RXWVIB9?page=6&annotation=QDQC7IJ2) “treated as aids to principled argument” ([Prochilo et al., 2019, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/BY9YFVWM))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8RXWVIB9?page=6&annotation=GJUUENK6) “In doing so, we will argue that NHST and p values have been misused across many organizational neuroscience works, and that reviewers of this literature too often accept statistical analyses and interpretations of data uncritically” ([Prochilo et al., 2019, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/BY9YFVWM))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8RXWVIB9?page=21&annotation=VP7A6XVZ) “Science is a cumulative and self-corrective endeavor.” ([Prochilo et al., 2019, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/BY9YFVWM))
