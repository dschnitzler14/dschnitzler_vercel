Learn about this concept with me! 

[[Misc/Digital Garden\|Digital Garden]] is a concept that unlike a blog, *ideas* are published out in the open while being refined and worked on. You can read more about it all over the internet, but [this](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) was the first thing I read about it when I came across the idea on  [Andy Matuschak's](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) page. 

I'm yet to see how exactly this will turn out, as I have a number of different projects, but for now I'm linking my daily notes, like my first one here: [[00_Daily Notes/2024-10-07\|2024-10-07]].
