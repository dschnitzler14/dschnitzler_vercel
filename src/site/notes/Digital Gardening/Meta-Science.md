The second pillar is my interest in the vague and broadly defined "meta-science". This is an interest in Science as a field, rather than a specific sub-topic. I am interested in untangling some of the mess that is Science.

Within this pillar, I have a few pieces of writing that I am not yet ready to share (ha!) but I promise I will soon.

I am also working on a big, ambitious project called Paperstars, which will have two approaches:

## 1	Post-publication review
- A virtual journal club and review site where users discuss, rate, and review papers for quality.
- **Goal: Improve the quality and trustworthiness of academic publications.**

## 2	Accessible science
- Targeted towards students and non-scientists to foster understanding and appreciation of research.
- **Goal: Increase scientific literacy through accessibility of scientific works which are freely available**
