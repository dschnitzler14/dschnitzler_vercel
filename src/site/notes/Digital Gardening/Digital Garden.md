## What is a Digital Garden?

Learn about this concept with me! 

A digital garden is a concept that unlike a blog, *active ideas* are published out in the open while being refined and worked on. You can read more about it all over the internet, but [this](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) was the first thing I read about it when I came across the idea on  [Andy Matuschak's](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) page. 

The way I have understood this, you can take a stroll through a digital garden and see what is growing. In other words, I am transparent about what I am working on, how it is going, and where I need help. I love this idea, because don't feel like I am trying to dupe you with a polished blog post telling you all about a project, when really, I feel like I am still trying to understand it myself.
