Inspired by the wonderful statistical textbook by [Crispin Jordan](https://biomedical-sciences.ed.ac.uk/experimental-design-and-data-analysis/what-to-do-with-experiments) I am working on an interactive companion shiny app that complements his work. 

Admittedly, I created the initial pilot example but have since decided a the following things

1. I want this to be a modular shiny approach (and having learned how to work with shiny in very linear approach it is hard to unlearn that)
2. I want this to open to other to help and provide valuable feedback and input, which requires ...
3. ... a guide to remain consistent across all chapters.
