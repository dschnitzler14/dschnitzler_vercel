This is the one of the three pillars of work I am passionate about. In this pillar I include all mentoring/ supervising, creating educational tools, teaching (when it is time), etc. 

I have actually always loved the educational aspect of being an academic - from leading tutorials for undergrads, to tutoring high school students 1:1 in biology, to leading practical science workshops during my internship at the Easter Bush Science Outreach Centre, where I also developed follow-up worksheets that were in line with their biology curriculum.

And now I get to continue this work, with my first co-supervisory role of our [[Digital Gardening/K Supervision\|PhD student K]] (keeping her anonymous, because I haven't asked her permission).

As a part of this pillar, I am also working on two (well actually three) shiny apps: 

1. One is being built to support the practical tutorials for a course of the scientific method ([[Digital Gardening/M14\| BlinkR Shiny App]]). I will also be helping with future course restructuring, as my PI has just taken over the running of it and I am keen to be involved. For now, we have re-designed the experiment that the students run to teach them all aspects of science - including building a hypothesis, designing the experiment, collecting the data, analysing the data in R, and finally interpreting it and writing it up in context. The app has a silly but catchy name BlinkR, and is designed to be a full workup of every step. It is also designed to be as accessible as possible, and can be run entirely on mobile (including the R sandbox)! At least that is the plan. 
2. I am in the process of writing an [[Digital Gardening/Textbook Companion\| interactive textbook companion app]] to an online statistical textbook delivered by a colleague
3. I am providing "shiny support" to a lab mate's project ([[Digital Gardening/L-analytics\|L-analytics]]) - just to tidy it up and make it publication ready. This isn't really _my_ project *per se*, but I am involved in it. The app itself is an analytical tool for educators to analyse class data.
