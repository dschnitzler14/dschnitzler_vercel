I had a long and hard think about where my interests lie and what I am passionate about. I tried to gather all my different projects into three key pillars:

[[Digital Gardening/Education\|Education]]
[[Digital Gardening/Meta-Science\|Meta-Science]]
[[Digital Gardening/Depression Research Questions\|Depression Research Questions]]

# Education


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/digital-gardening/education/" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">




This is the one of the three pillars of work I am passionate about. In this pillar I include all mentoring/ supervising, creating educational tools, teaching (when it is time), etc. 

I have actually always loved the educational aspect of being an academic - from leading tutorials for undergrads, to tutoring high school students 1:1 in biology, to leading practical science workshops during my internship at the Easter Bush Science Outreach Centre, where I also developed follow-up worksheets that were in line with their biology curriculum.

And now I get to continue this work, with my first co-supervisory role of our [[K Supervision/K Supervision\|PhD student K]] (keeping her anonymous, because I haven't asked her permission).

As a part of this pillar, I am also working on two (well actually three) shiny apps: 

1. One is being built to support the practical tutorials for a course of the scientific method ([[M14/M14\| BlinkR Shiny App]]). I will also be helping with future course restructuring, as my PI has just taken over the running of it and I am keen to be involved. For now, we have re-designed the experiment that the students run to teach them all aspects of science - including building a hypothesis, designing the experiment, collecting the data, analysing the data in R, and finally interpreting it and writing it up in context. The app has a silly but catchy name BlinkR, and is designed to be a full workup of every step. It is also designed to be as accessible as possible, and can be run entirely on mobile (including the R sandbox)! At least that is the plan. 
2. I am in the process of writing an [[Textbook Companion/Textbook Companion\| interactive textbook companion app]] to an online statistical textbook delivered by a colleague
3. I am providing "shiny support" to a lab mate's project ([[L-Analytics Project/L-analytics\|L-analytics]]) - just to tidy it up and make it publication ready. This isn't really _my_ project *per se*, but I am involved in it. The app itself is an analytical tool for educators to analyse class data.

# Meta-Science


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/digital-gardening/meta-science/" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">




The second pillar is my interest in the vague and broadly defined "meta-science". This is an interest in Science as a field, rather than a specific sub-topic. I am interested in untangling some of the mess that is Science.

Within this pillar, I have a few pieces of writing that I am not yet ready to share (ha!) but I promise I will soon.

I am also working on a big, ambitious project called Paperstars, which will have two approaches:

## 1	Post-publication review
- A virtual journal club and review site where users discuss, rate, and review papers for quality.
- **Goal: Improve the quality and trustworthiness of academic publications.**

## 2	Accessible science
- Targeted towards students and non-scientists to foster understanding and appreciation of research.
- **Goal: Increase scientific literacy through accessibility of scientific works which are freely available**

# Depression Research Questions


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/digital-gardening/depression-research-questions/" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">




This pillar is still a very ambiguous project concerning the evolutionary origins of depression. A brief summary of my thoughts that form the basis of my questions:

Anxiety has a clear evolutionary origin, wherein the "fight or flight" response is inappropriately engaged in an exaggerated manner. However, while the response is aberrant, the origin of this mechanism has a clear survival benefit. Conversely, depression is not usually discussed in similar terms of evolutionary adaptation. Nonetheless, the fundamental feature of fatigue experienced in depression may highlight that depression is in fact also a maladaptation of an evolutionary survival mechanism relating to energy conservation.

Firstly, fatigue is not only a diagnostic hallmark of depression according to the DSM-5 (REF), but has also been shown to be highly co-morbid with and correlated to depression @corfield_2016 . Secondly, comparisons have also been made between altered metabolic function of hibernating mammals (bears) and clinically depressed patients @tsiouris_2005 . Finally, specific environmental changes leading to depression (such as seasonal affective disorder) ( @eagles_2004 ) or indeed the effectiveness of specific treatments (e.g. exercise as intervention) ( @barbour_2007 ) also might highlight an underlying root cause.

When considering the theoretical frameworks of depression, there are many existing theories that may be unified by a higher level view of depression as a maladaptive mechanism of energy conservation. For example, the monoamine hypothesis, a theory in itself limited, may be further supported by the understanding that serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) plays an important role in initiating and maintaining hibernation in some mammals ( @haak_1991, @canguilhem_1986 ). Similar high-level comparisons may be drawn to other frameworks and features of depression, both on the neurobiological/ physiological level, as on a behavioural level. 

Another key piece of evidence may be found in the "Mitochondrial Hypothesis" of depression, implicating abnormal mitochondrial function as an underlying mechanism (reviewed in @ferrari_2017 , @gardner_2011 , @bansal_2016  ).

The current aims are as follows

1. Write a high-level overview review outlining existing evidence through the lens of energy conservation adaptations
2. Plan (and carry out) a data-based experiment using specific data, where alternative analysis might yield a potential target for further experimentation
