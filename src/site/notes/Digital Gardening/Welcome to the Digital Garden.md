I'm yet to see how exactly this will turn out, as I have a number of different projects, but for now I'm linking my daily notes. 

I am constantly making adjustments to how I want to present my online presence; my first instinct, which is aligned with my principles of open and transparent working, is to share everything I am working on - even the unfinished and "not-yet-perfect" processes. And that is exactly where I feel I meet an internal hurdle: frankly I am scared. I am scared that someone will read my unfinished work and dismiss my ideas because I haven't yet finished them. I am scared that I will not be taken seriously or that I will be judged for being stupid. That last one is a biggie if I'm being honest. 

I understand that not all notes need to be published in my Digital Garden. For example, my daily note from yesterday just reads:

> - meta science day!
>- today i am writing up the outline for the paperstars project proposal

that is less than informative and mindbogglingly boring. Who cares?! Especially when I haven't actually linked the proposal outline... because I am scared to. When I think about it, it's a pretty sneaky trick. I *say* I am sharing everything openly when in reality I am only sharing the fact that I am doing a thing, but not the actual thing. 

I will do better.

Now, I do want to share my daily notes, which are essentially my lab book that links out to different files (like, in the example above, that note links to the actual proposal outline), openly and transparently, but I think having a more structured approach will make more sense to bring the meat of what I am working on to the forefront... instead of describing the cutlery I am using.
