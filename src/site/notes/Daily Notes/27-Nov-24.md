- education day - I really want to get the measurement function of the shiny app for [[M14/M14\|M14]] to work.

https://lazyslowdown.com/developing-your-own-academic-index/
- This is it. This is the type of person I aspire to be in my future career. 
- Beronda talks about the problem with academic culture promoting competition, instead of support and growth.
- She defines her success outside the bounds of H-Index, journal impact factors, and the "traditional" tracks to "academic success". 
- She stresses the importance of defining your own track to success, instead of falling into the pre-defined lines of others
- Defining her own impact


Well my day got pretty sidetracked but I am not mad about it all...

i was working on the M14 app but then went to read the interview -> looked up Beronda Montgomery's website -> found interesting papers and blogs on there -> started reading those -> decided I actually would like to email her to thank her being so inspiring -> drafting an email -> realised I should actually tidy up my website so it is actually the open and transparent space I want it to be (it currently looks like it is but in actuality it is a whole lot of "I am working on XYZ" instead of "here is my work on XYZ" - bc showing my unfinished work is a challenge) -> started to re-organise my obsidian vault (which i publish directly from) so it makes more sense -> created a new template for weekly notes in which my daily "open lab book" notes can be nested -> trying to write summaries of what I'm working on and the progress in each -> trying to figure out if i can push this cool mindmap canvas that I have to the digital garden too -> in the background I am downloading 100's of GB of PhD data from OneDrive that needs to be done basically file-per-file because I don't have enough space on my computer for everything at the same time -> got a message about swapping a lab meeting presentation so just managing that 

I keep switching between these tasks because I keep forgetting what I was originally working on that made me change tabs in the first place.
