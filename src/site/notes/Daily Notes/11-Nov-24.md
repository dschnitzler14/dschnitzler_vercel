Back at work after a week off.

Today I want to throw myself back into the [[M14/M14\|M14]] app and try and make some good progress there. I have a few admin tasks that I need to complete and a [[Embracing variability in the search for biological mechanisms of psychiatric illness \|paper]] to read for journal club.

I've been thinking more about my time and how I use it (or don't) and where my priorities lie. More on this tomorrow.
