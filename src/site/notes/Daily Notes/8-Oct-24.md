Today I am trying to figure out how to link my Obsidian to my Notion. Ideally, I'd like to link any to-dos that come up in Obsidian to a notion database but I'm not sure how to accomplish this.

I have also set up two integrations to Zotero - one to add a citation in pandoc-style and one to add a reference list panel. That way, I can use a shortcut to insert a citation which automatically gets added in pandoc-reference style. One I move away from that citation, it turns [@Smith_2024] into Smith et al,, 2024 and I can see the reference in the reference panel. From there I can copy it into the note. I'm still trying to work out if I can add the bibliography automatically, without having to copy and paste. I especially like that the pandoc reference panel includes a link to zotero so I can view the paper there, as well as any other pdfs/ files conntected to that paper. There is also an option to just type "@" and start typing the author for citation suggestions.

Slowly working my way through my todos for today - currently trying to set up my Notion to give me a to-do menu for the week. I like this idea better than concrete blocking, as it gives me the freedom to select what I'm in the mood for, which is way better for my creativity.
