## What is a Digital Garden?

Learn about this concept with me! 

A digital garden is a concept that unlike a blog, *ideas* are published out in the open while being refined and worked on. You can read more about it all over the internet, but [this](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) was the first thing I read about it when I came across the idea on  [Andy Matuschak's](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) page.
